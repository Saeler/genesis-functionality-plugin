A functionality plugin for those using the Genesis Theme Framework for WordPress

#Genesis Functionality Plugin
A WordPress plugin built for Genesis Developers.

Instead of placing child theme independent code snippets into the functions.php file, use this plugin.

These code snippets include breadcrumb customizations, comment form customizations, search box code and more. There are certain things that live beyond the current Genesis child theme and instead of copying/pasting these code snippets from one child theme to another simply use this plugin to avoid the redundant work.

Take note: This plugin is FREE and is geared towards Genesis developers that are comfortable with writing Php code. We are working on a premium plugin that will give non-programmers the ability to change many Genesis settings from an admin screen without having to write a single line of code.
